# 0x06. Python - Classes and Objects

This subproject is part of the ALX Higher Level Programming curriculum and focuses on the concept of classes and objects in Python. In this project, you will learn how to define and work with classes, create objects, and utilize object-oriented programming principles.

The main goals of this subproject are:

- Understand the basic concepts of classes, objects, and attributes.
- Define and implement classes in Python.
- Create objects from classes and utilize class attributes and methods.
- Explore object-oriented programming principles, such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- Learn about special class methods, class attributes, and static methods.
- Develop a solid understanding of how classes and objects are used to structure and organize code.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this subproject, you should be able to:

- Define and use classes in Python.
- Create objects from classes and access their attributes and methods.
- Understand and apply object-oriented programming principles.
- Use class inheritance and explore different types of inheritance.
- Implement and utilize special class methods, class attributes, and static methods.
- Apply encapsulation to control the visibility and accessibility of class members.
- Implement polymorphism using class inheritance and method overriding.

## Requirements

- Python 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, or 3.8
- All files should be executed with Python 3.4.4 or later versions.

## Project Structure

This subproject contains several tasks, each focusing on a specific aspect of classes and objects. The tasks are organized in separate directories and have their own individual requirements and constraints. Make sure to read the instructions for each task carefully and follow any given guidelines or restrictions.

The tasks for this subproject are as follows:

1. Task 0: Empty class
2. Task 1: Square with size
3. Task 2: Size validation
4. Task 3: Area of a square
5. Task 4: Access and update private attribute
6. Task 5: Printing a square
7. Task 6: Coordinates of a square

Feel free to explore each task directory for more details on the requirements and expected outputs.

## How to Use

To use the code files provided in this subproject, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the ZIP file.
2. Navigate to the subproject directory `0x06-python-class_and_objects`.
3. Each task is located in a separate directory. Enter the task directory you want to explore.
4. Review the task requirements, constraints, and example outputs in the corresponding `README.md` file.
5. Open the Python file for the task and examine the code implementation.
6. You can run the Python file using the command `python3 <filename.py>` or as instructed in the task description.
7. Test the code with different inputs and verify that it produces the expected outputs.

Remember to read the project instructions and task requirements thoroughly for a better understanding of the expected behavior and constraints.
