# 0x07-python-test_driven_development

This subproject focuses on test-driven development (TDD) in Python. Test-driven development is an approach to software development that emphasizes writing tests before writing the actual code. The goal of this subproject is to introduce and practice the principles of TDD using the Python programming language.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the concept and benefits of test-driven development.
- Learn how to write effective tests using Python's testing frameworks such as unittest or pytest.
- Practice writing tests for various scenarios and edge cases to ensure code correctness.
- Gain familiarity with the process of writing code to pass the tests.
- Explore the importance of code coverage and ensure that tests cover all relevant cases.
- Understand the role of test-driven development in improving code quality, maintainability, and reusability.
- Apply test-driven development principles to solve coding challenges or develop small projects.

## Description

The "0x07-python-test_driven_development" subproject contains exercises and assignments related to test-driven development in Python. Each exercise focuses on a specific concept or problem that requires implementing code following the test-driven development approach.


## Testing

To test the code against the provided test cases, you can run the test files using a testing framework such as `pytest` or `unittest`. For example, to run the tests for `0-add_integer.py`, use the following command:

```bash
pytest -v tests/test_add_integer.py
```

Ensure that you have the necessary testing framework installed and configured in your development environment.
