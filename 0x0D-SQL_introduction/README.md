![SQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/SQL-Structured_Query_Language-blue)

Welcome to the **0x0D. SQL - Introduction** subproject repository! This subproject is part of the ALX-Holberton School Low-level Programming curriculum, focusing on introducing the fundamentals of **SQL (Structured Query Language)**.

## Project Overview

SQL is a domain-specific language used in programming and managing relational databases. In this subproject, we dive into the basics of SQL, including creating and managing databases, defining tables, querying data, and performing various database operations.

This subproject is designed to provide you with a solid foundation in SQL, enabling you to interact with databases, retrieve and manipulate data, and perform common database tasks.

## Getting Started

To get started with this subproject, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dhokabeatz/alx-higher_level_programming.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the subproject directory:

   ```bash
   cd 0x0D-SQL_Introduction
   ```

3. Explore the individual task directories to understand the specific SQL concepts and operations covered in each task.

4. Review the `sql_script.sql` files within each task directory to see the SQL queries and operations performed.

5. Optionally, if you have access to a database management system (e.g., MySQL, SQLite), you can execute the SQL script files in your chosen system to test and verify their functionality.
