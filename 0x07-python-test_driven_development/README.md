# 0x07-python-test_driven_development

This subproject focuses on test-driven development (TDD) in Python. Test-driven development is an approach to software development that emphasizes writing tests before writing the actual code. The goal of this subproject is to introduce and practice the principles of TDD using the Python programming language.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the concept and benefits of test-driven development.
- Learn how to write effective tests using Python's testing frameworks such as unittest or pytest.
- Practice writing tests for various scenarios and edge cases to ensure code correctness.
- Gain familiarity with the process of writing code to pass the tests.
- Explore the importance of code coverage and ensure that tests cover all relevant cases.
- Understand the role of test-driven development in improving code quality, maintainability, and reusability.
- Apply test-driven development principles to solve coding challenges or develop small projects.

## Description

The "0x07-python-test_driven_development" subproject contains exercises and assignments related to test-driven development in Python. Each exercise focuses on a specific concept or problem that requires implementing code following the test-driven development approach.

## Contents

The subproject may include the following files and directories:

- `tests/`: This directory contains test files that exercise the code under development. The tests are written to check the correctness of the code and cover various scenarios and edge cases.
- `0-add_integer.py`: This is an example file that contains a function or code to be developed using test-driven development. It is accompanied by its corresponding test file, such as `test_add_integer.py`, which contains the test cases for the `add_integer` function.
- `1-divide.py`: Another example file that requires implementing a `divide` function using test-driven development. Similarly, it is accompanied by its test file, such as `test_divide.py`, containing the relevant test cases.

## Getting Started

To get started with the "0x07-python-test_driven_development" subproject, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or navigate to the project directory.
2. Review the exercise or assignment instructions to understand the requirements and constraints.
3. Open the corresponding `.py` file, such as `0-add_integer.py`, in an editor to implement the required code.
4. Open the corresponding test file, such as `test_add_integer.py`, in an editor to write the test cases for the code under development.
5. Run the test file using a Python testing framework like `pytest` or `unittest` to check the initial failures.
6. Implement the code in the `.py` file to pass the test cases. Run the test file again to validate the changes.
7. Repeat steps 4-6 until all test cases pass and the code meets the requirements.
8. Proceed to the next exercise or assignment and repeat the process.

## Testing

To test the code against the provided test cases, you can run the test files using a testing framework such as `pytest` or `unittest`. For example, to run the tests for `0-add_integer.py`, use the following command:

```bash
pytest -v tests/test_add_integer.py
```

Ensure that you have the necessary testing framework installed and configured in your development environment.
