# 0x08. Python - More Classes and Objects

## Description

The "0x08. Python - More Classes and Objects" project focuses on further exploring the concepts of classes and objects in Python. It builds upon the foundational knowledge gained from previous Python projects related to classes and introduces more advanced topics and features.

Throughout this project, we delve deeper into object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and learn about important concepts such as inheritance, class methods, static methods, and properties. We also explore topics like data abstraction, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

The project aims to enhance your understanding and proficiency in using classes and objects to create well-structured and modular Python programs. You will gain hands-on experience in designing and implementing classes with more complex behaviors, relationships, and interactions.

## Learning Objectives

1. Reinforce understanding of classes and objects in Python.
2. Explore inheritance and how to create class hierarchies.
3. Understand and implement class methods and static methods.
4. Learn about properties and their use in controlling attribute access.
5. Practice data abstraction and encapsulation to create more robust classes.
6. Explore the concept of polymorphism and its practical applications.
7. Gain proficiency in designing and implementing advanced class structures.

By the end of this project, you should have a solid grasp of advanced concepts related to classes and objects in Python. You will be able to design and build more sophisticated programs using OOP principles, resulting in code that is easier to maintain, understand, and extend.

## Contents

This project contains the following files and directories:

- **README.md**: Provides an overview and description of the project.
- **1-rectangle.py**: A Python class that represents a rectangle and includes methods for calculating the area and perimeter.
- **2-rectangle.py**: Builds upon the previous Rectangle class by adding functionality to set and get the rectangle's width and height attributes.
- **3-rectangle.py**: Enhances the Rectangle class by adding validation checks for the width and height attributes.
- **4-rectangle.py**: Implements additional methods in the Rectangle class to calculate the area, perimeter, and string representation of the rectangle.
- **5-rectangle.py**: Expands the Rectangle class with a new method to print a graphical representation of the rectangle using the '#' character.
- **6-rectangle.py**: Extends the Rectangle class by adding a class attribute to keep track of the number of instances created.
- **7-rectangle.py**: Adds a new static method to the Rectangle class that compares two rectangles and returns the one with the larger area.
- **8-rectangle.py**: Implements a new class method in the Rectangle class that creates a new instance with the same width and height.
- **9-rectangle.py**: Enhances the Rectangle class by adding a property decorator to retrieve and set the rectangle's width and height attributes.
- **101-square.py**: Introduces a new Square class that inherits from the Rectangle class and includes methods specific to squares.

## How to Use

To use the classes and objects defined in this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd 0x08-python-more_classes`
3. Use the classes and objects in your Python programs by importing the relevant files:
   ```python
   from 1-rectangle import Rectangle
   from 101-square import Square
   ```

Refer to the specific file's documentation and comments for detailed usage instructions and examples.
