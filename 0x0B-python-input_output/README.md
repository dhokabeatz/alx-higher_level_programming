# 0x0B. Python - Input/Output

![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-v3.8-blue)

This is a sub-project of the ALX-Holberton School Low-level Programming curriculum, focusing on Python input/output operations. In this project, we explore various concepts related to file handling, input/output streams, and data serialization in Python.

The following topics are covered in this project:

- File I/O: reading and writing files, opening and closing files, file modes.
- Text file manipulation: reading line by line, manipulating text content.
- JSON and CSV: working with structured data formats.
- Pickling: serializing and deserializing Python objects.
- Error handling: handling exceptions during input/output operations.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into multiple directories, each containing Python scripts and code files related to specific concepts or tasks. Here is an overview of the directory structure:

- `0-read_file.py`: Python script to read the contents of a text file.
- `1-number_of_lines.py`: Python script to count the number of lines in a text file.
- `2-read_lines.py`: Python script to read specific lines from a text file.
- `3-write_file.py`: Python script to write content to a text file.
- `4-append_write.py`: Python script to append content to a text file.
- `5-to_json_string.py`: Python function to convert an object to its JSON representation.
- `6-from_json_string.py`: Python function to convert a JSON string to an object.
- `7-save_to_json_file.py`: Python function to save an object to a JSON file.
- `8-load_from_json_file.py`: Python function to load an object from a JSON file.
- `9-add_item.py`: Python script to add command-line arguments to a JSON list in a file.
- `10-class_to_json.py`: Python function to return the dictionary description of a class.
- `11-student.py`: Python class `Student` with JSON serialization and deserialization methods.
- `12-pascal_triangle.py`: Python function to generate Pascal's Triangle.
- `tests/`: Directory containing test files and scripts to verify the functionality of the implemented code.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dhokabeatz/alx-higher_level_programming.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd 0x0B-Python_Input_Output
   ```

3. Explore the individual scripts and code files related to specific concepts or tasks.

4. Execute the scripts or run the test files to verify the functionality.
